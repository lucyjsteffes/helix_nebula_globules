# helix_nebula_globules 

This is the repository filled with the Jupyter Notebooks that I wrote while I was a summer student at the Green Bank Observatory during the summer of 2021. This project looked at mapping two small molecular clouds in the Helix Nebula, called globules, in a variety of molecular lines. With most of these molecular lines being carbon based, we looked at a total of 12 different molecular lines, based primarily on a paper published by Andriantsaralaza, et. al, 2019.
